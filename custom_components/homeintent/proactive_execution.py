"""The only V12 path to a device: hand an accepted goal to the V10 pipeline.

V12 never builds a ``ServiceCallPlan``.  It passes explicit desired target
states to ``planner.materialize_target_states`` (operator selection,
Validator, ExecutionPolicy), reserves the ``ExecutionCoordinator``, runs the
existing ``PlanExecutor`` whose every write goes through the shared
policy-gated service executor, verifies each effect, records the GoalRun
via ``planner.goal_run_from_plan_result`` and appends it to the existing
``GoalRunStore`` (whose listener feeds V11 Experience).

``interactive_confirmed`` is True only for an explicit user answer.  For a
StandingPermission it is False, so the service executor refuses anything
the ExecutionPolicy would merely *confirm*: a permission cannot upgrade a
CONFIRM decision into an unattended action.
